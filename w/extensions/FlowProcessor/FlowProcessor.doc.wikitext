== Purpose ==
Provides a framework for an MVC (Model, View, Controller) flow system; ''flows'' are implemented separately.

== Features ==
* Secure: for code located in the database, the containing page must be ''edit protected'' (i.e. accessible normally only by users of the ''sysop'' group)
* Flexible: the whole MediaWiki framework is accessible
* Extensible
* Configuration help: see information in [[Special:Version]]

== Theory Of Operation ==
* A user accesses a ''flow based'' special page through '''Special:Flow$flow''' where ''$flow$'' is the identifier of the ''flow''
* The controller for flow ''$flow'' can be located in the following (in priority order):
* PEAR directory under the file path '''MediaWiki/Flows/$flow/controller.php''' 
* MediaWiki database under the page title ''Flow:$flow'' (see note below)
** Pages under the ''Flow'' namespace must be ''edit protected''

=== Controller Code ===
The controller code, whether located in a file or in the MediaWiki database uses the same format. The code section can optionally be enclosed in ''source'' tag for syntax highlighting with an extension such as [[Extension:Geshi]]. A skeleton controller code is found next:

<source lang='php'>

	/**
	 * Standard MediaWiki entry point for
	 * ''Special Page'' FlowTest
	 */
	 function wfSpecialFlowTest( $params )
	 {
		$proc = new MW_Flow_Test( $params );
		
		$proc->execute();
	 }

	class MW_Flow_Test extends SpecialPage
	{
	 var $params = null;
	 function __construct( &$params )
	 {
	  $this->params = $params;
	 }
	 function execute( )
	 {
	  $this->setHeaders();
	
	  var_dump( $this->params );
	 }
	
	 function getDescription()
	 {
	  return "Test1 !";
	 }
	}
</source>

== Dependencies ==
* An extra namespace named ''Flow'' can optionally be declared in order to edit the ''controller'' code for flows
* [[Extension:StubManager|StubManager extension version >= 1.2.0 ]]
* [[Extension:Geshi]] is optional; it is used to syntax highlight PHP code in ''controller'' pages when these are located in database as standard MediaWiki pages.

== Further Installation Notes ==
* The namespace ''Flow'' should, if used, be accessed controlled as it can allow a user to edit and execute arbitrary PHP code.
