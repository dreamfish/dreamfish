functions that enable machine-reading of wiki-content. For details and
further links, see http://semantic-mediawiki.org

== Developers ==

Development is coordinated by Markus Krötzsch and Denny Vrandecic.

Semantic MediaWiki development is funded by Institut AIFB of
Universität Karlsruhe, Germany; see http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de
Specific development tasks have been supported by the European Union under the
projects SEKT, NeOn, and Active. SMW has also been supported in the
Halo project funded by Vulcan Inc., where development is coordinated
by ontoprise GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany.

== Translations ==

Translations to various languages are provided and maintained by many people.
In general, main contributors can be found in the message file. Special thanks
are due to Siebrand Mazeland and the Betawiki project for their excellent
support in that matter.

Before moving to Betawiki, the following people already contributed significantly
to translating SMW:

* The Jurispedia project (www.jurispedia.org) has initiated and supported
  some of the translations:

** Translation to Arabic has been contributed by Mahmoud Zouari.

** Translation to French has been contributed by Pierre Matringe.

** Translation to Spanish has been contributed by Javier Calzada Prado and
   Carmen Jorge García-Reyes of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

* Slovak translation has been provided by user helix84.

* Hebrew translation has been provided by Udi Oron.

* Polish translation has been provided by Łukasz Bolikowski.

* Russian translation has been provided by Дмитрий Хорошев (Dmitry Khoroshev)

* Dutch translation has been provided by Siebrand Mazeland

* Chinese translations have been provided by 張致信 (Michael Chang)

* Italian translation has been provided by Davide Eynard and David Laniado

== Credits to other projects ==

* Most icons used by Semantic MediaWiki are derived from the "Crystal Clear"
  icon theme for KDE, which was created by Everaldo (everaldo.com).

* The sorttable java script function was developed by Stuart Langridge,
  and taken from http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable. The current
  code for sorting tables is derived from this original code.

* Many people have contributed to the project by providing helpful comments and
  suggestions. Among them are the members of the Semantic Wiki Interest Group
  (swikig@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de; see semanticweb.org), the people at the project
  mailing lists, and, of course, a number of anonymous reviewers. Thanks a lot!
