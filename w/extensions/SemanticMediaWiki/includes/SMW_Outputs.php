/**
 * This class attempts to provide safe yet simple means for managing data that is relevant
 * for the final HTML output of MediaWiki. In particular, this concerns additions to the HTML
 * header in the form of scripts of stylesheets.
 * 
 * The problem is that many components in SMW create hypertext that should eventually be displayed.
 * The normal way of accessing such text are functions of the form getText() which return a
 * (hypertext) string. Such a string, however, might refer to styles or scripts that are also
 * needed. It is not possible to directly add those scripts to the MediaWiki output, since the form 
 * of this output depends on the context in which the function is called. Many functions might be 
 * called both during parsing and directly in special pages that do not use the usual parsing and 
 * caching mechanisms.
 *
 * Ideally, all functions that generate hypertext with dependencies would also include parameters to
 * record required scripts. Since this would require major API changes, the current solution is to have 
 * a "temporal" global storage for the required items, managed in this class. It is not safe to use
 * such a global store accross hooks -- you never know what happens in between! Hence, every function
 * that creates SMW outputs that may require head items must afterwards clear the temporal store by
 * writing its contents to the according output.

	 * actual item that should be added to the output HTML header. In the first
	 * case, the $item parameter should be left unspecified.
	 * 
	 * @note This function does not actually add anything to the output yet.
	 * This happens only by calling SMWOutputs::commitToParserOutput(),
	 * SMWOutputs::commitToOutputPage(), or SMWOutputs::commitToParser(). Virtually
	 * every function that eventually produces HTML text output using SMW functions
	 * must take care of calling one of those committing functions before passing
	 * on control. It is not safe to commit later, e.g. in a hook that is expected
	 * to be called "soon" -- there might always be other hooks first that commit the
	 * existing data wrongly, depending on installed extensions and background jobs!
