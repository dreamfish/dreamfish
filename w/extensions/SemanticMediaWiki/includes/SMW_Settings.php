# This setting allows you to select in which cases you want to have a factbox
# appear below an article. Note that the Magic Words __SHOWFACTBOX__ and
# __HIDEFACTBOX__ can be used to control Factbox display for individual pages.
# Other options for this setting include:
##
//$smwgShowFactbox = SMW_FACTBOX_NONEMPTY; # show only those factboxes that have some content
//$smwgShowFactbox = SMW_FACTBOX_SPECIAL # show only if special properties were set
$smwgShowFactbox = SMW_FACTBOX_HIDDEN; # hide always

# Should the toolbox of each content page show a link to browse the properties
# of that page using Special:Browse? This is a useful way to access properties
# and it is somewhat more subtle than showing a Factbox on every page.

###
# Should SMW accept inputs like [[property::Some [[link]] in value]]? If
# enabled, this may lead to PHP crashes (!) when very long texts are used as
# values. This is due to limitations in the library PCRE that PHP uses for
# pattern matching. The provoked PHP crashes will prevent requests from being
# completed -- usually clients will receive server errors ("invalid response")
# or be offered to download "index.php". It might be okay to enable this if
# such problems are not observed in your wiki.

$smwgQSortingSupport    = true; // (De)activate sorting of results.
$smwgQRandSortingSupport = true; // (De)activate random sorting of results.
$smwgQDefaultNamespaces = NULL; // Which namespaces should be searched by default?
                                // (value NULL switches off default restrictions on searching -- this is faster)

                             // If unsupported comparators are used, they are treated as part of the queried value

###
# Further settings for queries. The following settings affect inline queries
# and querying special pages. Essentially they should mirror the kind of
# queries that should immediately be answered by the wiki, using whatever
# computations are needed.
##
$smwgQMaxSize = 12; // Maximal number of conditions in queries, use format=debug for example sizes
$smwgQMaxDepth = 4; // Maximal property depth of queries, e.g. [[rel::<q>[[rel2::Test]]</q>]] has depth 2

// The below setting defines which query features should be available by default.
// Examples:
// only cateory intersections: $smwgQFeatures = SMW_CATEGORY_QUERY | SMW_CONJUNCTION_QUERY;
// only single concepts:       $smwgQFeatures = SMW_CONCEPT_QUERY;
// anything but disjunctions:  $smwgQFeatures = SMW_ANY_QUERY & ~SMW_DISJUNCTION_QUERY;
// The default is to support all basic features.

### Settings about printout of (especially inline) queries:
$smwgQDefaultLimit = 50;      // Default number of rows returned in a query. Can be increased with limit=num in #ask
$smwgQMaxInlineLimit = 500;   // Max number of rows ever printed in a single inline query on a single page.
$smwgQPrintoutLimit  = 100;   // Max number of supported printouts (added columns in result table, ?-statements)
$smwgQDefaultLinking = 'all'; // Default linking behaviour. Can be one of "none", "subject" (first column), "all".


###
# Further settings for queries. The following settings affect queries that are
# part of concept pages. These are usually chosen to be les restricted than
# inline queries, since there are two other means for controling their use:
# (1) Concept queries that would not be allowed as normal queries will not be
# executed directly, but can use pre-computed results instead. This is the
# default.
# (2) The whole Concept: namespace can be restricted (using some suitable
# MediaWiki extension) to an experienced user group that may create more
# complex queries responably. Other users can employ thus defined concepts in
# their queries.
##
$smwgQConceptCaching = CONCEPT_CACHE_HARD; // Which concepts should be displayed only if available from cache?
       // CONCEPT_CACHE_ALL   -- show concept elements anywhere only if they are cached
       // CONCEPT_CACHE_HARD  -- show without cache if concept is not harder than permitted inline queries
       // CONCEPT_CACHE_NONE  -- show all concepts even without any cache
       // In any cases, caches will always be used if available.
$smwgQConceptMaxSize = 20; // Same as $smwgQMaxSize, but for concepts
$smwgQConceptMaxDepth = 8; // Same as $smwgQMaxDepth, but for concepts

// Same as $smwgQFeatures but for concepts (note: using concepts in concepts is currently not supported!)
$smwgQConceptFeatures = SMW_PROPERTY_QUERY | SMW_CATEGORY_QUERY | SMW_NAMESPACE_QUERY |
                        SMW_CONJUNCTION_QUERY | SMW_DISJUNCTION_QUERY;

// Cache life time in minutes. If a concept cache exists but is older than
// this, SMW tries to recompute it, and will only use the cache if this is not
// allowed due to settings above:
$smwgQConceptCacheLifetime = 24*60;


### Predefined result formats for queries
# Array of available formats for formatting queries. Can be redefined in
# the settings to disallow certain formats or to register extension formats.
# To disable a format, do "unset($smwgResultFormats['template']);" Disabled
# formats will be treated like if the format parameter had been omitted. The
# formats 'table' and 'list' are defaults that cannot be disabled. The format
# 'broadtable' should not be disabled either in order not to break Special:ask.
##

	'csv'        => 'SMWCsvResultPrinter',
	'json'       => 'SMWJSONResultPrinter'
);
##

### Predefined sources for queries
# Array of available sources for answering queries. Can be redefined in
# the settings to register new sources (usually an extension will do so
# on installation). Unknown source will be rerouted to the local wiki.
# Note that the basic installation comes with no additional source besides
# the local source (which in turn cannot be disabled or set explicitly).
# Set a new store like this: $smwgQuerySources['freebase'] = "SMWFreebaseStore";
##
$smwgQuerySources = array(
//	'local'      => '',
);
##

### Default property type
# Undefined properties (those without pages or whose pages have no "has type"
# statement) will be assumed to be of this type. This is an internal type id.
# See the file languages/SMW_LanguageXX.php to find what IDs to use for
# datatpyes in your language. The default corresponds to "Type:Page".
##
$smwgPDefaultType = '_wpg';
##

###
# Settings for RSS export
##
$smwgRSSEnabled = true;  // use to switch off RSS (it's not worse than querying Special:Ask, but attracts more users)
$smwgRSSWithPages = true; // Should RSS feeds deliver whole pages or just link to them?
##

###
# Settings for OWL/RDF export
##
$smwgAllowRecursiveExport = false; // can normal users request recursive export?
$smwgExportBacklinks = true; // should backlinks be included by default?
$smwgOWLFullExport = false; // decides, if the RDF export will export, by default,
                            // OWL Full or rather nice OWL DL.
                            // Can be overriden in the RDF export class.
// global $smwgNamespace;                     // The Namespace of exported URIs.
// $smwgNamespace = "http://example.org/id/"; // Will be set automatically if
// nothing is given, but in order to make pretty URIs you will need to set this
// to something nice and adapt your Apache configuration appropriately. This is
// done, e.g., on semanticweb.org, where URIs are of the form
// http://semanticweb.org/id/FOAF
##

###
# The maximal number that SMW will normally display without using scientific exp
# notation. The deafult is rather large since some users have problems understanding
# exponents. Scineitfic applications may prefer a smaller value for concise display.
##
$smwgMaxNonExpNumber = 1000000000000000;
##

###
# SMW defers some tasks until after a page was edited by using the MediaWiki
# job queueing system (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Job_queue).
# For example, when the type of a property is changed, all affected pages will
# be scheduled for (later) update. If a wiki generates too many jobs in this
# way (Special:Statistics and "showJobs.php" can be used to check that), the
# following setting can be used to disable jobs. Note that this will cause some
# parts of the semantic data to get out of date, so that manual modifications
# or the use of SMW_refreshData.php might be needed.
##
$smwgEnableUpdateJobs = true;
##

###
# Overwriting the following array, you can define for which namespaces
# the semantic links and annotations are to be evaluated. On other
# pages, annotations can be given but are silently ignored. This is
# useful since, e.g., talk pages usually do not have attributes and
# the like. In fact, is is not obvious what a meaningful attribute of
# a talk page could be. Pages without annotations will also be ignored
# during full RDF export, unless they are referred to from another
# article.
